<h2><span class="small"><i>About the Author</i></span>
<br />&mdash; Retired in 1976 &mdash;
<br /><i>Now City Historian for South Portland, Maine</i></h2>
<p>B. F. Kennedy, Jr. was born in Portland, Maine in 1916 and
has spent most of his life in this area, attending grammar school
and high school in Portland. Mr. Kennedy has also worked as a
ship chandler and a drugstore clerk. A collector by nature, his
favorite hobbies besides treasure-hunting are bottle collecting
and mineralogy.</p>
<p>The author has done extensive research on buried and sunken
treasure locales. Working on information furnished by Mr. Kennedy,
scuba divers located three brass Revolutionary War cannons
just off Portland Head light. Mr. Kennedy has personally located
old coins, an Indian axe circa 1640, and other valuable artifacts,

<h1 title="">BURIED TREASURE OF CASCO BAY:
<br />A Guide For The Modern Hunter</h1>
<div class="pb" id="Page_19">19</div>
<h2 id="c1"><span class="small">CHAPTER I</span>
<br />HOW TREASURE WAS BURIED</h2>
<p>The word, &ldquo;treasure,&rdquo; has excited people the world
over for centuries. When we were mere children we read
about hidden treasure being buried on lonely isles, by bands
of cutthroat pirates, also the burying of caches of money by
the outlaws and bandits of the old West.</p>
<p>The early settlers were always hiding their money from the
Indians and bandits, and the best place to put their money
was, of course, in the ground, as they had no bank vaults in
which to keep it safe.</p>
<p>So down through the years thousands of dollars in coin
was hidden in this fashion. Many of these caches are being
discovered today in the back yards of rustic old houses, in
old wells, along the stone walls of century-old homesteads, in
<span class="pb" id="Page_20">20</span>
fact almost anywhere around the property.</p>
<p>The many islands in Casco Bay were choice locations for
the early settlers; to settle on an island was one way to slow
up the advance of Indian raiding parties. The Indians, of
course, would raid some of the islands; but it was not
convenient for them because of the trip across the open
water in order to reach their destination; therefore many
treasures that were buried on these islands still remain to be
discovered by the modern day treasure hunter. A good many
of these hidden caches were buried in old iron kettles, tough
bags made of animal hides, old iron chests and almost
anything that would keep the coins from getting too wet and
corroded in the ground.</p>
<p>Now for some treasure hunting locations for the modern
hunter armed with his metal detector. First, we will go to an
old fort in Casco Bay, Maine, namely, &ldquo;Fort Gorges,&rdquo; we will
call this location number one on our list.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_21">21</div>
<h2 id="c2"><span class="small">CHAPTER II</span>
<br />FORT GORGES</h2>
<p>Fort Gorges is on Hog Island, Portland Harbor, Casco
Bay, it is a stone fort in a commanding position on a reef,
guarding the entrances to the upper harbor as well as to the
ship channel. Although designed to complete the harbor
defense, it was not built until much later than the earlier
forts, Preble and Scammell. It was commenced in 1858 but
was not completed until 1864 or 1865. It was built under the
direction of Captain Casey, of the United States Engineering
Corps, and in bomb-proofs and barbette, was designed to
receive 195 guns. Although a formidable looking fortress it
was designed for short range guns, so the introduction of
modern heavy ordnance made its period of usefulness a brief
one. Fort Gorges may be reached by boat from Portland or
<span class="pb" id="Page_22">22</span>
Cushings Island.</p>
<p>The parade ground inside the fort is a dirt one, anybody
seeking buried treasure there, might find such articles as
buttons, shoe buckles, coins, bayonets and other properties
carried by the soldiers who were stationed there at the end of
the Civil War. The buried artifacts would not be too deep,
maybe one or two feet for an average. This fort would be one
of the ideal locations for the modern treasure hunter and his
metal detector. I&rsquo;m sure your time would not be wasted in a
two or three hour search there. If you decide to visit the old
fort, do not forget to take a box lunch, as the salt air will
create a wonderful appetite.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_23">23</div>
<h2 id="c3"><span class="small">CHAPTER III</span>
<br />FORT SCAMMELL</h2>
<p>On House Island, Casco Bay, you will find Fort
Scammell. This fort was built in 1808, under the direction of
Mr. H.A.S. Dearborn, who under authorization of the War
Department, purchased for twelve hundred dollars, all the
southwest part of House Island containing twelve acres more
or less. On the highest point of this island an octagonal
block-house of timber was erected, with a porthole and a gun
on each side. The upper story projecting over the lower, two
or three feet; contained the battery. On the low upright
center timbers of the roof, was a carved wooden eagle with
extended wings. Fort Scammell, like its sister, Fort Preble,
was named for a Revolutionary officer, Colonel Alexander
<span class="pb" id="Page_24">24</span>
Scammell. Fort Scammell was never so extensive a fortification
as Fort Preble.</p>
<p>It was enlarged at the time of the Civil War, until its
equipment called for seventy-one pieces. Fort Scammell may
be reached by boat from either Portland or South Portland.</p>
<p>The treasure hunter, here too, will have a great time with
his detector. There should be, hidden out of sight, a number
of old relics that could be located with a good metal
detector. The date of the fort being as I mentioned 1808,
therefore the artifacts that might be found here, would really
have some value. Don&rsquo;t forget to secure permission before
you hunt on any property. The owner will like you better for
this.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_25">25</div>
<h2 id="c4"><span class="small">CHAPTER IV</span>
<br />PEAKS ISLAND</h2>
<p>The Island of Peaks is located in Casco Bay and is
approximately three miles due east from Portland. It only
takes a fifteen minute boat ride to arrive at Peaks.</p>
<p>There are several good locations here for the treasure
seeker, especially if he or she is armed with a good metal
detector.</p>
<p>The first location that I shall mention is located on the
northerly end of the island. It is about three-quarters of a
mile from the boat landing.</p>
<p>A few years ago construction of an addition to the Island
school house was begun; during the excavating, two silver
coins were dug up. These coins were identified as pieces-of-eight,
or Spanish silver dollars. Where they came from or who
buried them, or lost them there; still remains a mystery. If
<span class="pb" id="Page_26">26</span>
one could secure permission to go over the remaining part of
the yard, there is no telling what might be discovered.</p>
<p>Another spot worth checking out, is located on the back
side of the island at a place called &ldquo;Picnic Rocks&rdquo; or
&ldquo;Whaleback&rdquo;. Here, near the roadway, stands; or stood; a
huge elm tree. This tree was approximately eight feet in
diameter. A few years ago a fire broke out in this section of
the island, and nobody seems to know whether or not the
lonely elm was burned. If it was, the huge charred stump
should still be there. The Author has not checked this
situation as yet; but intends to shortly.</p>
<p>On the ground surrounding this immense tree, there are
several mounds, believed to be Indian graves. A real good
search of the area, might be well worth one&rsquo;s time.</p>
<p>Last, but not least, the beaches on the back side of the
island, (or north-easterly side) should be gone over very
carefully with the metal detector.</p>
<p>Pirates were in this area around 1726, and most anything
might be buried along these sandy strips. Not only buried,
but who knows what might have been dropped or lost by
these cutthroats of long ago. The Boston Pirate, Edward
Low, was said to have plied these waters, in and around
Casco Bay about 1726 or 1727.</p>
<p>Who knows what beach he might have landed on, in one of
his longboats?</p>
<p>I most certainly would give this island a darn good check
with my detector, especially the beaches and the bankings
leading up from them.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_27">27</div>
<h2 id="c5"><span class="small">CHAPTER V</span>
<br />CUSHING&rsquo;S ISLAND</h2>
<p>One of our next stops should include this island of
Casco Bay. It is located just across the channel from Willard
Beach, South Portland; in an easterly direction from Willard
Beach.</p>
<p>First of all, why do we wish to treasure hunt here? A little
history at this point might help the modern hunter, just a bit.
We will go back in history to the year 1632. The first pirate
ever heard of in the annals of piracy, was called; &ldquo;Dixie
Bull&rdquo;. This pirate was believed to be of English descent. He
robbed and sacked Pemaquid, Maine, in 1632; then set sail for
Richmonds Island, which was next on his list to be robbed.</p>
<p>However, as the story goes, a storm came up with very
high winds, this pirate galleon was just entering the channel
between South Portland and Cushing&rsquo;s Island, so &ldquo;Dixie
<span class="pb" id="Page_28">28</span>
Bull&rdquo; decided to put into a cove on Cushing&rsquo;s to wait out the
storm.</p>
<p>It is said that he put ashore and buried some of the loot
taken from Pemaquid. There are several coves facing the
channel. Which one was the exact location of his landing?</p>
<p>Your guess is as good as mine, but I most certainly would
go over these coves, beaches, and bankings very carefully. If
anything was located here, you can bet it will be a real find.</p>
<p>The year 1632 was a long time ago, and any artifact
uncovered here would be worth its weight in gold, not only
as an antique but as a real historical piece.</p>
<p>Any article found here and checked as to relationship to
&ldquo;Dixie Bull&rdquo; and proved authentic; would be priceless.</p>
<p>The history of Cushing&rsquo;s Island dates back to the year
1623, when Captain Levett came over from the old country.
He was looking for a likely spot to settle and Cushing&rsquo;s Island
turned out to be that spot.</p>
<p>Captain Levett was the first white man to settle in Casco
Bay. He traded with the Indians and did not try to cheat
them. He traded cheap jewelry for beaver and otter skins and
got along famously with the whole tribe. Levett built his
house near Cellar Point.</p>
<p>The Island of Cushing&rsquo;s has had many names, among these
being Andrews, Portland, Fort Island and Bangs Island.
Ezekiel Cushing took the island over in 1762 and it has been
called Cushing&rsquo;s Island ever since.</p>
<p>If any of you readers are skin diving enthusiasts, you might
try a few dives in and around the channel between Cushing&rsquo;s
Island and Willard Beach, South Portland, as a number of
cannon were dumped overboard during the War of 1812, and
are probably still lying on the bottom of this channel.</p>
<p>All sides of the island should receive a good going-over
with your detector, as this island is steeped in history of the
bygone era of sails.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_29">29</div>
<h2 id="c6"><span class="small">CHAPTER VI</span>
<br />SIMONTON&rsquo;S COVE
<br />or
<br />WILLARD BEACH
<br />So. Portland</h2>
<p>This cove located on the easterly end of South
Portland facing Casco Bay is the scene of early settlers to this
part of the Cape, (Elizabeth).</p>
<p>Today the cove is known as Willard Beach. It was named
for Captain Ben Willard, who was born there in 1828. Ben
was a fisherman, pilot, and stevedore.</p>
<p>This beach was used by the early settlers, of about 1813 as a
landing spot for their fishing boats. Many little homesteads
sprung up in this area in the early 1800&rsquo;s.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_30">30</div>
<p>The old houses, of course, are gone now, but who can tell
what might still be hidden along the beach or in the vicinity
of the beach and cove.</p>
<p>Around the old point, that is on the south side of the
beach, would be a likely area for the metal detector. The old
fishing shacks that were there have vanished now, but many a
cash deal was made on this old point of land. There may be
still, some loose coins lying around with a few feet of dirt
on top of them.</p>
<p>A few blocks to the rear of the beach was an old tavern
that the stage coaches stopped at years ago. This old house is
still standing. You probably will not be able to secure
permission to go over the property as the house is occupied. I
told you about this old place, just to convince you that this
entire area is a fine one to look over.</p>
<p>If stage coaches came and went from this locality you can
bet that this would be an ideal location in which to hunt. Go
over the beach, then try the land, but for goodness sake, be
sure to get permission from any property owner before you
hunt on his property. We do not want you to get arrested and
land in court.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_31">31</div>
<h2 id="c7"><span class="small">CHAPTER VII</span>
<br />PORTLAND HEAD LIGHT AREA</h2>
<p>The history book tells us that many of the old sailing
vessels came to grief in this area. Portland Head Light is
located on the government reservation of Fort Williams and
you definitely can not search here; but the area outside of
the Fort should receive your attention. If you proceed in a
southeasterly direction along the shoreline, going away from
the Fort there is no telling what you might find. The ships
that were wrecked in this area of the bay, carried all kinds of
cargo; such as silks, silverware, jewelry, tools, money, tea,
coffee, guns, pottery, glassware, etc., just to mention a few.</p>
<p>Many of these articles washed ashore from the wrecked
ships. It is my guess that there still remains, buried in the
sand of the many inlets and coves; relics of a bygone era.</p>
<p>One of the wrecked ships in this area was the Annie C.
<span class="pb" id="Page_32">32</span>
Maguire. She came ashore in 1886 and went to pieces on
Portland Head Light Reef.</p>
<p>One of the earlier shipwrecks was that of the &ldquo;Bohemian.&rdquo;
She came to grief on Alden&rsquo;s Rock; located about three miles
off the Cape Elizabeth shore. The year was 1864. She had
sailed from Liverpool, England; her destination being Portland,
Maine. Many of the Cape Elizabeth residents still have
articles in their possession that came from the &ldquo;Bohemian&rdquo;.
(The Author has a silver plated spoon from this wrecked ship,
that will rest in the Cape Historical Society.)</p>
<p>The days that followed the disaster were busy ones for the
people along the shores of the mainland, as well as the islands
of Casco Bay. They were salvaging the bolts of silk cloth,
along with many other items that were washed ashore. The
story goes; that the ladies of the area soon were seen wearing
new dresses made out of the cloth from the &ldquo;Bohemian&rdquo;.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_33">33</div>
<h2 id="c8"><span class="small">CHAPTER VIII</span>
<br />CLIFF ISLAND</h2>
<p>The location of this island will take us down the bay
beyond Peaks Island, and about three miles due east from
Long Island.</p>
<p>Many stories have been written about Cliff Island. Some
were fact and others were legendary. We will try to stay with
the facts as close as possible. First a little about the
geography of Cliff Island. It has great coves, low sand bars,
and many lush pine groves; a nicer haven for the artist,
scholar, or traveler, has not been found. The Island has not
always been known as Cliff; for it originally was called,
&ldquo;Crotch&rdquo; Island, named after a curious &ldquo;H&rdquo; shaped chasm
that was hewn out of the solid ledge on the southeastern side
of the island. On each side of the &ldquo;crotch&rdquo;, are great coves
<span class="pb" id="Page_34">34</span>
which should be given your undivided attention, as to metal
detection.</p>
<p>Near Gravelly Cove, there once stood an old house, built in
the early 1700&rsquo;s. Its walls were constructed of hand-hewn
wooden planks, stood on end. It was termed a &ldquo;piggin&rdquo;, a
type of dwelling very uncommon in Maine, there being only
one other like it built at Kittery Point, about 1630. It is said
to have been erected by John Merriman, one of the earliest
settlers.</p>
<p>One of the Indian battle grounds was the field above the
old wharf at Strouts Point. Here many of the early settlers
met their death at the hands of the savages.</p>
<p>On May 2, 1780, a party of Colonial soldiers camped on
the island for several days, while on their way to the eastward
in search of British cruisers.</p>
<p>There is one prominent legend of the island that the
natives keep alive. It concerns the notorious, &ldquo;Captain Kief&rdquo;,
who was believed to be a smuggler and one-time pirate. He
lived alone in a hut and during the stormy weather, would
fasten a lighted lantern to his horse&rsquo;s neck; riding up and
down the narrow stretch of the island, in the hope of luring
passing vessels to their doom on the treacherous reefs.
Unsuspecting pilots soon found their ships pounded to pieces
and their cargoes salvaged and confiscated by this island
ghoul. He got rich out of the spoils.</p>
<p>Today the islanders hate to point out to the curious, the
&ldquo;Captain&rsquo;s&rdquo; own private graveyard, a pretty, grassy meadow
which ever since has been known as &ldquo;Kief&rsquo;s Garden&rdquo;, and
where his innocent victims are said to sleep their last long
sleep.</p>
<p>Now the reader should understand, that by reading the
preceding tale, you have a good location here on Cliff, for a
real treasure hunt. The Author wishes you good hunting.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_35">35</div>
<h2 id="c9"><span class="small">CHAPTER IX</span>
<br />RICHMOND&rsquo;S ISLAND</h2>
<p>Here we have one of the earliest settlements in the
Casco Bay area. In 1604, Champlain, the great explorer,
landed here on Richmond&rsquo;s Island. This was, of course,
sixteen years before the landing of the Pilgrims at Plymouth
Rock, Massachusetts. In other words, this island has a real old
history in the annals of time.</p>
<p>The first trader or shop keeper to settle here was Walter
Bagnall. He traded with the Indians and got along fine until
he started to cheat them. That was his undoing, as they
found it out and later killed him. This island was &ldquo;the&rdquo;
trading post of the area. People came by boat and overland to
trade here.</p>
<p>Richmond&rsquo;s Island today is rather a deserted place
compared to the old days. There used to be thirty-five or
<span class="pb" id="Page_36">36</span>
forty houses here, plus two or three churches.</p>
<p>The leading industry of the island was the curing and
drying of salt fish that were caught just off shore. You can
walk around the entire shoreline of this island in about an
hour and a half. A metal detector should react here to
something buried long ago. The island, being a trading post,
should reveal some treasures of the bygone era. The island
has a wonderful beach on the westerly side. If you also
happen to be interested in shells you will find many &ldquo;sand
dollars&rdquo; here. A &ldquo;sand dollar&rdquo; is a shell fish shaped like a
silver dollar. They are very interesting to study.</p>
<p>There is a breakwater from the mainland out to this island
and you can cross over at low tide, but the walking is pretty
rugged due to the large granite blocks used in construction.
These blocks were placed at various angles so it is hard to
walk over them. The best way to the island is by boat, either
from Breakwater Point or from Crescent Beach, Cape
Elizabeth. A small rowboat is all you need, as the inlet that
you cross is not very wide.</p>
<p>Richmond&rsquo;s Island is owned by a gentleman who lives on
the mainland. I would most certainly get his permission
before landing on the island. We treasure hunters want to live
up to our good reputation, so don&rsquo;t spoil it by trespassing
without the owner&rsquo;s O.K.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_37">37</div>
<h2 id="c10"><span class="small">CHAPTER X</span>
<br />TURNER&rsquo;S ISLAND</h2>
<p>This small island was settled by Ralph Turner in
1659. He was a farmer who kept his cows and garden on this
island. He, however, did not live on the island, but had a
house on the mainland of the Cape. The river on which the
island was located was called Casco River. It is now called
Fore River and is a part of Casco Bay, or an inlet from the
Bay.</p>
<p>Turner&rsquo;s house was located near Barbeery Creek, which
now is industrial property in South Portland.</p>
<p>I mention this location because of its early settlement. If
this area was screened carefully some mighty interesting relics
could be revealed.</p>
<p>To reach this area you proceed to South Portland, then on
to the Pleasantdale area. Anyone there can tell you how to
<span class="pb" id="Page_38">38</span>
get to Turner&rsquo;s Island. Of course the island is not an island
any longer, as the gap between the island and mainland has
been filled in and today the island appears to be part of the
mainland. You can see with careful study that the terrain still
resembles the little island of 1659.</p>
<p>This area should have something hidden along the shoreline
that would make a metal detector sing.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_39">39</div>
<h2 id="c11"><span class="small">CHAPTER XI</span>
<br />PORTLAND, MAINE
<br />EASTERN SHORE LINE</h2>
<p>The largest city in Maine offers the modern treasure
seeker good hunting grounds, especially the eastern side of
town. This area is called the east-end bathing beach. The
shore line here was the scene of Indian attacks and burning of
houses back in the year 1775 when Portland was known as
Falmouth Neck. The British Admiral, Mowatt, attacked and
destroyed by shell fire the area from the Eastern Promenade
to Monument Square, and included the waterfront in this
destruction.</p>
<p>If you think about this attack you will come to the
conclusion that many historical artifacts were lost in the
ruins of the fire. Some of them are probably still in the area,
<span class="pb" id="Page_40">40</span>
buried under three or four feet of dirt, or maybe deeper. Of
course the shoreline is built up now, but you still have a good
chance of finding something along the beach, the banking
near the railroad tracks, and some of the surrounding area. As
I have mentioned continually throughout this book, don&rsquo;t
under any circumstances dig without securing the property
owner&rsquo;s permission.</p>
<p>Portland was founded by George Cleeves in 1633, so you
see that any article found that dates back to this era would
be a real find. The Portland area as a whole is steeped in
history, the first settlers arriving only thirteen years after the
Pilgrims themselves.</p>
<p>A particularly nice spot for the detector to do its work is
the foot of Fort Allen Park along the railroad tracks and
shoreline at the base of the hill.</p>
<p>Many of the old windjammers used to anchor in the
channel just off this point. Therefore, the longboats or small
boats from the mother ship would land on the beach, while
their occupants went ashore to complete business dealings
with the shopkeepers concerning cargoes, etc.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_41">41</div>
<h2 id="c12"><span class="small">CHAPTER XII</span>
<br />CAPE ELIZABETH SHORE LINE</h2>
<p>When starting out to check this shoreline a good
starting point in my estimation would be at the &ldquo;Two
Lights&rdquo; section of the Cape. Go along the shore checking as
you proceed; all spots, both among the rocks, sand, and
higher water line. A short walk will bring you to the State of
Maine Park. Here you will not be able to use your
instruments as there are restrictions, but go beyond the park
in a westerly direction and this will lead you around the
point to Crescent Beach.</p>
<p>In years past there have been a number of articles
washed up on the beach. Just above the beach is a salt-grass
area that comes between the beach and woods just beyond. I
would most certainly check this section, then proceed along
<span class="pb" id="Page_42">42</span>
to the field that lies about a thousand feet distant, also in a
westerly direction. There is no telling just what might be
buried here. A good method to use in this area, with your
detector, is the &ldquo;grid pattern&rdquo;; that is, walk up and down for
awhile then reverse direction and go across your own path.
The design you will be making will look like the plate on a
waffle iron. This method is employed by most of the
professional treasure hunters, and is most effective.</p>
<p>The history of the Cape shoreline goes back to the year
1604, when Champlain, the great explorer, was in this
neighborhood. He landed first on Richmond&rsquo;s Island, then
explored quite a bit of the mainland. He could have landed or
walked from Richmond&rsquo;s to the mainland. Maybe some of his
belongings lie buried in this historical locality. Treasure
seeking demands that you don&rsquo;t give up too easily, keep
trying, and remember these hidden objects will not let you
know where they are, you have to find them. Faint heart
ne&rsquo;er won fair lady, so get in there and really search.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_43">43</div>
<h2 id="c13"><span class="small">CHAPTER XIII</span>
<br />MACKWORTH&rsquo;S ISLAND</h2>
<p>Mackworth&rsquo;s Island has an unusual and interesting
background. According to historians, the Indian Sagamore of
Casco, known as Cocawesco, made his home here. On an old
English chart it is called Macken&rsquo;s Island. The island was
named for Arthur Mackworth, who came to this country in
1631. He died in 1657 and was buried on the island.</p>
<p>The State of Maine School for the Deaf is located on this
island, which may be reached from the mainland via a
causeway. Please get permission before trespassing on this
property. Go to the administration building and ask if they
mind if you search along the outer shoreline. An area such as
this could reveal many nice finds because of the fact that
both our Indian chief and the first white settler here, lived on
the island a good many years. There seems as though there
<span class="pb" id="Page_44">44</span>
must be artifacts lying around hidden from view just waiting
to be discovered.</p>
<p>To reach Mackworth&rsquo;s Island take Route 1 north from
Portland, cross Martin Point Bridge, and you will see the
island to your right as you are crossing this bridge. The first
road to the right after leaving the bridge should take you to
the causeway leading over to the island. You could also row
over to the island from the mainland as it is a very short trip.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_45">45</div>
<h2 id="c14"><span class="small">CHAPTER XIV</span>
<br />JEWELL&rsquo;S ISLAND</h2>
<p>Now here is an island that fairly reeks with legend and
treasure lore. Certainly no island in the Bay so ideally lends
itself to piratical practices with its deep landlocked harbor,
hidden coves and thick woods that even today shelter all
observation from the sea. All of which lends credence to
staunch belief that at one time in its history it was the
favorite haunt of smugglers and pirates. Jewell is only a little
island of but two hundred and twenty-one acres, one of the
outer islands that fringe the boundaries of Casco Bay. Being
out of the beaten path of tourist travel, it has not received
the attention that its natural beauties merit.</p>
<p>George Jewell, from whom the island is said to have taken
its name, came from Saco, Maine, and is presumed to have
purchased the island from the Indians in 1637.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_46">46</div>
<p>From earliest times it has been traditional in the history of
Jewell Island that a pirate&rsquo;s treasure lies hidden somewhere
on its shores.</p>
<p>Jewell Island has several so-called &ldquo;treasure markers.&rdquo;
These &ldquo;markers&rdquo; are a pile of flat stones lain one on the
other, until the marker reaches a height of about four or five
feet. It is near these markers that treasure was supposed to
have been buried. How near, or just where, is a question that
might be answered by your metal detector. I most certainly
would give the shore and beaches a good going over.</p>
<p>This island can be reached by the tourist boats that go to
almost all the islands in Casco Bay. If the boat does not stop
at Jewell Island, you can go to Cliff and cross over to Jewell
by rowboat. The trip across the channel is a short one.</p>

<br />GREAT CHEBEAGUE ISLAND</h2>
<p>Here we have one of the largest islands in Casco Bay.
The name is pronounced &ldquo;Shar-Big.&rdquo; This name in Indian
language means &ldquo;land of many springs.&rdquo; The Indians used
this large island as a gathering place for their outings and
feasts. Many Indian families would come to Chebeague Island
and spend the day boating, fishing and eating. The Indians
were the forerunners of the modern day tourist.</p>
<p>On Chebeague you will find large shell heaps still visible
after hundreds of years. These piles of shells are the debris of
countless feasts held by the Indians.</p>
<p>Numerous relics of these Indian days have been found, and
as late as 1935 crude implements of warfare, some household
utensils, Indian skulls, and a curious stone pipe were
unearthed.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_48">48</div>
<p>The first legal document pertaining to Chebeague was a
transfer of ownership dated 1650, so this island also dates
back to a period of seventeenth-century history. Chebeague has
many large and small coves which should command your
attention. When you land on Chebeague ask about the old
homes there. In the old days there were many homesteads on
this island and some of them still remain. The area
surrounding these structures should have a number of hidden
relics buried around the yard. Don&rsquo;t forget to ask the owner
for his O.K. before you start any excavating.</p>
<p>The immediate shoreline would be the next location to
receive a treatment from your metal detector. As I have
mentioned, the Indians had their outings along the beaches
and shoreline. The metal detector, of course, is very valuable
on a treasure hunt, but don&rsquo;t forget to use your eyes also.
Some of the artifacts you may discover will not be made of
metal, but could be stone, wood or even leather. Articles
such as these, of course, would not register on your
instrument, but nevertheless they would qualify as historical
treasure.</p>
<p>Even up to the present day some of these Indian relics are
being found and preserved by local residents. The Maine
Historical Society has a nice collection for your examination.
The Society is located next to the Longfellow House on
Congress Street, Portland. You will be most welcome; go in
and browse a bit. It is worth the time, as many interesting
pieces are on display, and it will give you an idea of what you
might uncover yourself.</p>
<p>To reach Great Chebeague Island you take a boat from
Custom House Wharf, Portland. Most anyone can tell you
how to get to the wharf. The boat trip takes only a short
time to reach this island of the Indian days.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_49">49</div>
<h2 id="c16"><span class="small">CHAPTER XVI</span>
<br />GREAT DIAMOND ISLAND</h2>
<p>The history of this island, located just across the
channel in a northerly direction from Peaks Island, dates
back to the year 1635 when a lease was given to George
Cleeves and Richard Tucker by Sir Fernando Gorges, the
King of England&rsquo;s Representative. Diamond Island is one of
the earliest settled parts of our state. There is an old chart
dated 1760 that shows farm buildings on the south side of the
island. One can still see the remains of an old graveyard with
unmarked stones. The deep water near Diamond Cove was
believed to be the area in which Captain Christopher Levett,
the first white man to explore Casco Bay, anchored his vessel
in 1623.</p>
<p>Sir William Phips, the greatest treasure hunter of all time,
<span class="pb" id="Page_50">50</span>
also anchored at Great Diamond before going to the
Louisburg campaign.</p>
<p>There is a particular area that should be examined
carefully. This spot is almost directly across the channel from
Trefethen&rsquo;s Landing of Peaks Island. Here you will find an
old abandoned ruin of a farmhouse cellar. This old cellar
belonged to one of the oldest farms on the island. I most
certainly would check this area very thoroughly, as articles of
real interest may still be in the vicinity. Check the old brick
walls then the inside area, after which proceed to go over the
grounds surrounding the cellar. Some of the ancient tools and
implements may be waiting for your metal detector to bring
them to light.</p>
<p>At the beginning of this chapter I mentioned George
Cleeves and Richard Tucker. They were the founders of
Portland, Maine, so this section of Casco Bay is a hub of the
wheel of history in this bay and the state itself. The south
shore is the side towards Peaks Island and the metal detector
should be used along the beaches and high ground on this
side of the island. Don&rsquo;t forget to check around any large
trees that stand alone, as the Indians liked to bury their dead
in these areas. Stone clubs, tomahawks and grain grinding
tools might be in the immediate vicinity.</p>
<p>Looking back over the history of this island it wouldn&rsquo;t be
too far fetched to imagine the landing here of pirates, maybe
to take on fresh water and lumber. Speaking of pirates, I
would check the south-easterly end of the island, as this
section is the closest to the open sea, a good landing spot for
a longboat coming from the old galleon itself anchored a few
hundred yards from shore. It could be a locality where a little
pirate loot may be buried, who knows?</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_51">51</div>
<h2 id="c17"><span class="small">CHAPTER XVII</span>
<br />POND ISLAND</h2>
<p>In the vicinity of Harpswell you will find a small
island that became one of the most treasure explored islands
in Casco Bay. Here we find, if we check our legends of the
islands, the spot of land in our island studded bay that is said
to be the location of the Boston Pirate Low&rsquo;s hidden treasure
chest. To tell you a little about this I will go back to the year
1726. At this time Pirate Low was sailing in and around
Casco Bay as he was preying on the northern shipping lanes.</p>
<p>A Spanish galleon named &ldquo;Don Pedro Del Montclova&rdquo; left
South America with a treasure of gold and jewels bound for
Spain. She sailed up from South America and reached the
Florida Keys, then just as she started to cross the Atlantic, a
British gunboat gave chase.</p>
<p>The galleon swung off her course and headed north along
<span class="pb" id="Page_52">52</span>
the Atlantic Coast until she finally outran the gunboat. She
was now at the entrance of Casco Bay and her Captain
thought that this would be a good location in which to hide
among the many islands. What he did not know, however,
was that Pirate Low was anchored in Casco Bay and saw the
Spanish galleon coming around the point.</p>
<p>Low boarded the galleon, killing the crew and sinking the
ship. He then knew from talking to the Spanish crew previous
to their killing, that the British gunboat was on its way to the
bay. Low decided to hide the treasure as fast as he could. He
landed on Pond Island and threw the chest of gold and jewels
into the fresh water pond that is there. He knew the location
of the pond because he had been there before to fill his water
casks.</p>
<p>After hiding the treasure he immediately left the vicinity
ahead of the gunboat. He was later captured and hung, so he
never came back to claim his hidden booty.</p>
<p>Many treasure hunters have gone over this island and land
surrounding the old pond, but to my knowledge nobody has
located this cache of gold and jewels. The pond itself is now
dry, I understand. Maybe the treasure is deeper than average;
instead of four or five feet deep, this one could be fifteen or
twenty feet deep. It is a problem in geology, just how the
wind and rain change the terrain in so long a time.</p>
<p>I would say that a pretty sensitive detector should be used
in this area in order to reach real depth.</p>
<p>This preceding tale is mostly legend passed down through
the years, but who knows whether or not it is all legend?</p>
<p>I would give this island a very careful examination with my
instrument if I were you. There&rsquo;s just no telling what is there.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_53">53</div>
<h2 id="c18"><span class="small">CHAPTER XVIII</span>
<br />FORT PREBLE</h2>
<p>Here we have a fort that was started in 1808 and
finished about 1812, just before the War of 1812. It was named
for Commodore Preble, prominent in the Revolutionary
Navy. At the time of the Civil War it was enlarged and had a
complement of 72 guns. The early fortress was of whitewashed
brick ramparts which faced the channel.</p>
<p>On the site of this fort a log meeting house once stood, a
gathering place for the earliest settlers of this area. This
location may be reached by going to South Portland and
proceeding to the Maine Vocational Technical Institute on
Fort Road. This school now occupies the Fort Preble
grounds. The old fortifications are in the rear of the grounds
at the water&rsquo;s edge.</p>
<p>When you arrive at the fort, go to the Administration
Building and secure permission to check the old ramparts.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_54">54</div>
<p>Here you will find many old gun emplacements. These
should be given your undivided attention; use your metal
detector very carefully as many artifacts and relics must still
be lying about. Don&rsquo;t forget to check the beach area in front
of the old ramparts. The ground inside the granite walls
should be another interesting spot for the metal detector.
One of the earliest cemeteries in the entire Cape is located on
this point of land. It is called the &ldquo;Thrasher&rdquo; burying ground.
The Thrashers were the early settlers of this area. They had a
large farm on the point back in the 1600&rsquo;s.</p>
<p>Much trading with the Indians took place on Fort Point
where Preble was erected, so I would definitely not miss this
location on my treasure hunting expedition.</p>
<p>As I mentioned earlier the Civil War was in progress when
the fort was enlarged. There are probably many articles of
this period still in the compounds of old Fort Preble, so go
over the area and see what you can come up with. I&rsquo;m sure
your time will not be wasted.</p>
<p>This is one of the easiest locations to reach, as it is on the
mainland, and a short ride from Portland either by bus or
taxi. There is a restaurant within hailing distance of the fort,
so you can get a lunch and keep right on with your search.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_55">55</div>
<h2 id="c19"><span class="small">CHAPTER XIX</span>
<br />FRENCH&rsquo;S ISLAND</h2>
<p>Considerable Indian interest is attached to
French&rsquo;s Island in the lower bay. An Indian skull was found
under three feet of clam shells and it was figured that the
skull was three or four centuries old.</p>
<p>French&rsquo;s Island is located between Great Chebeague and
Goose Island and to the south of Bustin&rsquo;s Island. To reach
this island you proceed to Flying Point, Freeport, then by
boat to Bustin&rsquo;s Island, then over to French&rsquo;s. It is a short
trip from the mainland. You will have to hire someone with a
motorboat to take you across the bay. This island is privately
owned, so permission must be secured before you land and
start your treasure hunt. I believe a Portland resident owns
this island. A check of the records will no doubt reveal the
owner&rsquo;s name and address.</p>
<p>The finding of an Indian skull proves that if there were
Indians on French&rsquo;s Island there could have been early
<span class="pb" id="Page_56">56</span>
settlers, and also pirates on this small island. In days gone by
some of the pirates preferred small islands on which to hide
their ill-gotten gains.</p>
<p>When going over this island I would give special attention
to the beaches. The pirates sometimes buried their treasure in
a hurry, as a government boat would be coming up fast in
pursuit. It has been mentioned in the history books that this
island was a headquarters for an Indian Sagamore, or Chief.
Some of their trinkets and relics of the early settlers may still
be hidden from view awaiting your detection.</p>
<p>Many of these small islands had clear fresh water springs
that attracted the seafarer. The longboats would put in and
fill their casks with fresh water for the coming voyage, so a
check in this area for a spring might pay off.</p>
<p>Again I say, please be sure to get permission from the
property owners before you proceed with your expedition.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_57">57</div>
<h2 id="c20"><span class="small">CHAPTER XX</span>
<br />BAILEY&rsquo;S ISLAND</h2>
<p>Here history tells us that the first settlers arrived
about 1743. This island is one of the larger islands of Casco
Bay and there are still many of the old homesteads there. A
definite link with this early period still standing on Bailey
Island is the so-called &ldquo;Gardiner&rdquo; house built in 1818. It
stands back from the road at the northern end of the island
and in the rear is an ancient well. The timber came from the
ruins of a log house built by Deacon Timothy Bailey, for
whom the island was named.</p>
<p>Another interesting house on the island is one called the
&ldquo;Captain Jot&rdquo; homestead. As the name implies, this house
belonged to a sea captain. It dates from 1763, an interesting
location for the treasure seeker. Your detector should be able
to locate something of interest in this vicinity.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_58">58</div>
<p>There are many spots to be checked on this island. A good
idea is to ask the natives where these old houses are.</p>
<p>I have found that the inhabitants of a particular locale can
tell you the history of various points of interest, as most of
the older folk have this information at their finger tips. It
usually pleases them, the fact that you are asking questions
about their own backyard. They will point out many facts
and locations that the history books have overlooked.</p>
<p>This island may be reached from the mainland. From
Portland take the highway leading to Brunswick, Maine.
There you will find signs directing you to Bailey&rsquo;s Island. It is
a beautiful trip to the island. The road is bordered by tall
Maine pines, rolling meadows, streams, old farms and neat
modern homes. To me the trip down to the island is one of
lasting memory.</p>
<p>During your treasure hunting time on the island, don&rsquo;t
forget to have some tasty Maine lobster for lunch. You can
purchase these delicious morsels right on the island all
cooked. There are tables and benches at which you may sit
while enjoying one of Maine&rsquo;s famous lobster dinners.</p>
<p>The beaches that face the open sea should be checked
carefully with your detector, as many landings have taken
place here from 1763 until today. Who knows what might be
buried along these shores? This island should be one of the
finest on your check list, as it is so easy to reach. The author
wishes you the best of luck here.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_59">59</div>
<h2 id="c21"><span class="small">CHAPTER XXI</span>
<br />ORR&rsquo;S ISLAND</h2>
<p>One of America&rsquo;s famous authors, Harriet Beecher
Stowe, made this island stand out in the annals of Casco Bay
by writing her popular story, &ldquo;The Pearl of Orr&rsquo;s Island.&rdquo;
This story was published in 1862 when the island itself was
practically isolated and unknown. The appearance of this
story was a literary event for thousands of Mrs. Stowe&rsquo;s
readers.</p>
<p>The island takes its name from two brothers; namely,
Clement and John Orr, who in 1748 bought the greater part
of the island for two shillings an acre. The brothers originally
came from the north of Ireland.</p>
<p>Here on Orr&rsquo;s the treasure hunter will find at the north end
of Long Cove a small cove that is known as &ldquo;Smuggler&rsquo;s
Cove.&rdquo; Orr&rsquo;s Island is probably the best known island in
<span class="pb" id="Page_60">60</span>
Casco Bay. In the old days a rickety old wooden bridge was
built by the settlers to connect the island with the mainland,
and it was really living dangerously to go over this ancient
structure. This old bridge has now been replaced by a modern
causeway.</p>
<p>On the Island of Orr&rsquo;s many Indian attacks were repulsed
by the early inhabitants. If you are real careful when
searching with your detector, you should find Indian relics or
artifacts that were buried by the sea-going population of the
1700&rsquo;s. Many a three- and six-masted schooner sailed in and
out of the harbor at Orr&rsquo;s Island. Who knows what pirate ship
visited this area in the dark of night with maybe a contraband
cargo?</p>
<p>In this area I think that I would check every little cove and
inlet very carefully. Most anything might be found hidden
along the shores and, also, near some of the old dwelling
sites. A good check along the roadway to and from the island
might reveal a hidden article. Especially check both sides of
the roadway and work back a ways from the edge of the road
about twenty or thirty feet. The old road did quite a bit of
curving as it wound its way to the island. These curves have
been eliminated to a great extent with the building of the
new road. As I mentioned, if you grid the area well back
from the road, you have an excellent chance of discovering
some by-gone article. It could be a pewter mug, buckles from
shoes, gold coins and who knows what else?</p>
<p>Take your metal detector and ply the ocean side of the
island. This section seems most likely to have been populated
by the seaman, smuggler, pirate or what have you. It may be,
that during trading and making business deals with each
other, the seaman could have lost some coins in the dirt to be
buried over and lost for hundreds of years. Also many of the
natives, no doubt, kept their savings in the private caches
buried from sight at the rear of their cabins.</p>
<p>Another likely area to check out would be the area where
the old ferry used to dock. The ferry ran from Orr&rsquo;s Island to
Bailey&rsquo;s Island. If you wanted to take the trip you signaled
<span class="pb" id="Page_61">61</span>
the ferryman by lowering the flag that was flying high on the
tall flagpole. The ferry would proceed across the narrow
passage of water known as Will&rsquo;s Gut. The fare was fifteen
cents to Bailey&rsquo;s Island, but to return to Orr&rsquo;s Island, it
would cost you twenty-five cents.</p>
<p>The sea trip from Portland to Orr&rsquo;s Island by the island
steamers of Casco Bay is a journey to remember. You, of
course, can reach Orr&rsquo;s Island by automobile via a road that
swings down to Orr&rsquo;s from Brunswick, Maine. When you
reach Brunswick just follow the signs and soon you will be on
the &ldquo;Island of the Pearl.&rdquo; Good hunting to you.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_63">63</div>
<h2 id="c22"><span class="small">CHAPTER XXII</span>
<br />HARPSWELL NECK</h2>
<p>This long neck of scenic beauty is a close neighbor of
Orr&rsquo;s Island. It lies to the north, northwest and can be
reached by auto via the rotary traffic circle at Brunswick,
Maine.</p>
<p>Many stories and tales have been written about Harpswell,
some fact and others legend. Each has its own place in
American literature. Located on the east side of the
Harpswells is the site of the Skolfield Shipyard. This yard was
the birthplace of many rugged sea-going vessels. Some were
three masted and others six. These full-rigged ships sailed
into practically every seaport along the Atlantic Coast. A visit
to this site will be worth your time. The next stop on our
<span class="pb" id="Page_64">64</span>
tour of Harpswell might be the old meeting house where the
early settlers held their town meetings and discussed the
Indian problem. The area near the meeting house would be a
good hunting ground for your detector, but please don&rsquo;t
forget to secure trespassing rights before you proceed with
your search.</p>
<p>One of the phantom legends of Harpswell, and perhaps one
of the best, was put into poetry by one of America&rsquo;s best
known poets; namely, John Greenleaf Whittier. His poem was
called, &ldquo;The Dead Ship of Harpswell.&rdquo; It was written in 1866
and was inspired by the legendary tale told to the younger set
by their grandfathers and grandmothers. I suppose a few
great-grandmothers and grandfathers also told the ghostly
tale. The preceding words of phantom legend will give you a
bit of atmosphere when you arrive on Harpswell.</p>
<p class="tb">As you go down this peninsula check all coves and inlets
with your instrument. Leave nothing uninvestigated, as this
area is one of several that was abandoned in the late 1600&rsquo;s
due to Indian uprisings.</p>
<p>I would give my special attention to Pott&rsquo;s Point; this
point is located on the very end of the neck and a good place
for pirates or smugglers to land and hide a chest of
doubloons, pieces-of-eight or other booty taken from some
poor unfortunate vessel that came into their grasp. Check the
beach area, then go into the interior of the &ldquo;Point.&rdquo; Many
treasures have been buried under a large tree or boulder that
was a thousand yards from the shore. If you see a rocky cave
or large boulder check them for mysterious markings, such as
crosses, circles, arrows and such, carved or cut into the rocky
surface. Some of these hidden treasures have been located by
following a crude direction sign left by a cut-throat on a
rocky ledge or in a rocky cave.</p>
<p>Use your probing rods as you check with the detector. The
exact center of the location of any buried object can be
determined much more easily with the probe. Your camera
also is a much needed piece of equipment. You can record
<span class="pb" id="Page_65">65</span>
your treasure hunting progress on film for viewing by your
interested treasure-seeking friends. Study your movies or still
pictures with your associates. Maybe some suggestions by
them would be of real help to you on your next treasure
expedition.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_67">67</div>
<h2 id="c23"><span class="small">CHAPTER XXIII</span>
<br />SHELTER ISLAND</h2>
<p>&ldquo;Shelter Island,&rdquo; as you pronounce the name, it
sounds almost like &ldquo;Treasure Island&rdquo; of Robert Louis
Stevenson fame. It not only sounds like it, but this island
comes as close to &ldquo;Treasure Island&rdquo; as any island in the entire
bay. We don&rsquo;t seem to read or hear too much about this small
island in the very middle of Casco Bay. It is more or less
hidden from the open sea and was a perfect hiding place for
the smuggler and privateer who plied these waters while
trying to escape and hide from the revenue cutters.</p>
<p>What I have just mentioned in the preceding paragraph
should make a treasure hunter&rsquo;s ears stand up. This island was
not a refuge for smugglers and pirates only; it also was a
refuge for the early settlers of Mere Point on the mainland.
<span class="pb" id="Page_68">68</span>
The settlers would be driven from the mainland by vicious
attacks from the Indians, and they would flee to their
blockhouse on Shelter Island. This blockhouse was built for
this exact purpose, so you can imagine what you might find
on this island in the way of buried treasure; not only artifacts
from the early settler days, but also relics from the old days
of smuggling and privateering.</p>
<p>The location of Shelter Island is as follows: Take the
Harpswell road from Brunswick on Route 1 and proceed
about half way down the Harpswell Neck, then go to the
northern side of the shoreline. There you will see Shelter
Island just off shore. The Author has never been over to the
island, but has seen it from a distance. It looks very inviting
as a spot to do some real down-to-earth treasure hunting.</p>
<p>On my trip to Harpswell, I think that I would inquire as to
the ownership of this little island, and try to include it in my
tour of treasure hunting locations. Here is a nice area for the
metal detector and probe to do their work. I think, with any
luck at all, you should locate something of treasure value
here.</p>
<p>Please check as to trespassing rights before you land here.
It&rsquo;s better to be safe than sorry. I most certainly would check
the coves and beaches very carefully, especially any good
landing place for a longboat.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_69">69</div>
<h2 id="c24"><span class="small">CHAPTER XXIV</span>
<br />LONG ISLAND</h2>
<p>On our way down the bay we will find Long Island
nestled in between Peaks and Great Chebeague Islands, but
don&rsquo;t sell this island short, as it has a history going back to
the sixteen hundreds. The first settlers were here around
1640, so you see we have a background of real early history
on Long Island.</p>
<p>The Indians gave special attention to Long Island because
of its many fresh water springs. It was, and still is, a
delightful place to put on an old fashioned shore dinner. The
early settlers and Indians would join together and have a
mammoth outdoor shore dinner on this island to celebrate
some new trading deal between each other.</p>
<p>There are several nice beaches that should receive your
attention when checking with the detector, but, by all means,
<span class="pb" id="Page_70">70</span>
don&rsquo;t forget to check the areas surrounding the fresh water
springs. The areas leading back from the beaches should be
gone over with the thought in mind to watch for the sunken
ground locations that could have been the site of old log
cabins or vegetable cellars. Many a treasure has been
uncovered in a locale such as this.</p>
<p>Stone walls also are a source of buried monies and
household valuables. A small metal detector would be just
the instrument to use when checking out cellars, walls, floors,
old wells, etc. The six-inch loop detector would be perfect
for this type of hunting. These small detectors are much
more sensitive than the larger ones when seeking small
objects. Some of these smaller detectors also will detect
through salt water where the larger detector will work only
through fresh water. The larger detector, of course, will give
you greater depth. I have read where some of these larger
instruments will detect a metal object that is five feet long at
a depth of twenty feet. This is a super job of metal detection.
The type of detector used, of course, has a lot to do with the
size of the object that you are searching for. Personally, if I
were a novice at treasure hunting, I would purchase a small
detector and learn how to operate it before purchasing a
larger one. Of course, if you know how to operate a detector,
the size will make no difference whatsoever. The Author has
a small detector and is now thinking about the purchase of a
larger model. The choice of size is strictly up to you. Happy
Hunting!</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_71">71</div>
<h2 id="c25"><span class="small">CHAPTER XXV</span>
<br />PETTENGILL ISLAND</h2>
<p>To locate this small island we will follow Route 1
north from Portland until we reach Freeport Village. Here we
will make a right turn at the yellow blinker light and follow
the signs to Flying Point. When we reach Flying Point we will
look offshore across the small bay and there we will see
Pettengill Island. There are no inhabitants on this island
although I believe it is privately owned.</p>
<p>The Author rowed over to Pettengill and landed on the
rocky southwest point. Here I discovered an old iron cleat
that had been sunk into a large boulder. The hole in the rock
had been hand drilled to accommodate the cleat. Whoever
drilled this socket in the hard rock surely worked hard, as I
<span class="pb" id="Page_72">72</span>
could see it would take a person three or four hours to drill a
hole this deep with a hand drill. What type of boat was
moored to this cleat would be anyone&rsquo;s guess. The cleat was
checked as to age and was believed to be about a hundred
years old.</p>
<p>There are several open areas in the thick pine groves that
could easily be locations for buried treasure. On the easterly
side of the island you will find a small cove and perfect beach
for landing. Maybe some band of pirates also thought that
this cove was a good spot to land and hide a bit of loot. I
would go over this cove area very carefully, and as I
mentioned, don&rsquo;t forget the southwest point of the island. I
still think you could come up with something at either
location. Your iron probe would serve you in good stead, as
most of the clearings are covered with pine needles. The
probe will push easily through the needles until you reach
harder ground. Most of the islands are very rocky, so
anything that was buried would not be too deep due to the
rocky condition, probably two or three feet deep in the
ground.</p>

<h2 id="c26"><span class="small">CHAPTER XXVI</span>
<br />SEBASCODEGAN or GREAT ISLAND</h2>
<p>This large island lies between Orr&rsquo;s Island and the
mainland. You will cross this island on your way to Orr&rsquo;s
Island and Bailey&rsquo;s Island. It seems to be part of the mainland
but actually is not. The name &ldquo;Sebascodegan&rdquo; in Indian
language means &ldquo;marshy place and a place for gun-firing.&rdquo;
Thus, the interpretation would mean &ldquo;a good place for
hunting water fowl.&rdquo;</p>
<p>To reach Sebascodegan proceed the same way as though
you were going to Orr&rsquo;s Island. That is, go to Brunswick and
follow the signs to Orr&rsquo;s and Bailey&rsquo;s. On the way down the
neck you will notice several historic old churches with the
old burying ground nearby. Many of the old gravestones have
some really interesting epitaphs. It is worth a short stop just
to read a few of these.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_74">74</div>
<p>The first settlers to reach Sebascodegan arrived in the year
1639. The first bridge to the mainland was built in 1839, so
you see, you also have some real old history connected with
this area of the bay.</p>
<p>Near the end of the Revolutionary War several British
privateers were preying on the shipping lanes in and around
Casco Bay. One of the most notorious of these sea-going
bandits was a &ldquo;Captain Linnacum.&rdquo; He was of Scotch descent
and commanded a schooner called the &ldquo;Picaroon.&rdquo; This
pirate captured many luckless coasting boats, and it is said,
he buried several caches of loot in and around Sebascodegan
Island. Nobody seems to know just where the treasures might
be hidden. The many caves and inlets should command your
attention. I also would not forget to check the inland areas.
In the old days this island was criss-crossed with Indian trails,
so you see, anything might be unearthed along some of these
old trails. Of course, the trails have long since disappeared,
but I would use my detector in general directions leading
from the coves to the forests. I would give special attention
to river banks and brooks. There has been many a rich find
located in the vicinity of a river or stream.</p>
<p>The Brunswick Chamber of Commerce used to put out a
regional map of the Brunswick area. This map was a very
good job, and it showed many of the islands in the Brunswick
area. You might stop and check at the Chamber of
Commerce. They may still be able to help you.</p>
<p>Cundy&rsquo;s Harbor is located on the very end of this island
and it would be a likely spot for any pirate to anchor to
come ashore. I would not forget to go over this area very
carefully with my detector. You could ask some of the
natives where the schooners used to land in the old days. I
am sure they would be pleased to help you with some
information on the subject.</p>

<br />TREASURE HUNTING EQUIPMENT</h2>
<p>Some of the treasure hunters that I know really load
themselves down with all sorts of equipment. They remind
me of a pack mule. You do not have to have a truck load of
this hardware on your back. Here I will mention the essential
articles you should take along on your next treasure hunting
expedition.</p>
<p>First, I would put down on my list a metal detector, of
course. Next, I would take a folding Army trench shovel.
These can be purchased in almost all Army surplus stores.
Next, I would take along my camera, movie or still, and
several rolls of film. A permanent record on film can be
enjoyed in years to come. The next article to be brought
along should be an iron probing bar. You could make your
own or purchase one from the metal detector dealer. They
are very inexpensive and very valuable on a treasure hunt. If
you decide to make your own, just obtain a five-foot length
of &frac14;-inch rolled steel. This may be purchased from any steel
manufacturing plant.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_76">76</div>
<p>Next on the list should be old clothes. Never go on a
treasure hunt with your best clothes on. You may have to
wade along a breakwater, cross a brook, and who knows what
else. I know I got caught by the in-coming tide one day and
had to walk along a breakwater up to my hips in the cold
Atlantic. Wear a pair of old shoes or canvas loafers.
Something you don&rsquo;t care about and then it will make no
difference if they get a salt bath or covered with mud.</p>
<p>Last, but by no means least, take along plenty of lunch, or
be sure that the area in which you intend to hunt contains a
store or a Maine lobster shop. This Maine sea air will create a
terrific appetite.</p>
<p>Best of luck to all my readers.</p>

trademark. Contact the Foundation as set forth in Section 3 below.

1.F.

1.F.1. Project Gutenberg volunteers and employees expend considerable
effort to identify, do copyright research on, transcribe and proofread
works not protected by U.S. copyright law in creating the Project
Gutenberg-tm collection. Despite these efforts, Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic works, and the medium on which they may be stored, may
contain "Defects," such as, but not limited to, incomplete, inaccurate
or corrupt data, transcription errors, a copyright or other
intellectual property infringement, a defective or damaged disk or
other medium, a computer virus, or computer codes that damage or
cannot be read by your equipment.

1.F.2. LIMITED WARRANTY, DISCLAIMER OF DAMAGES - Except for the "Right
of Replacement or Refund" described in paragraph 1.F.3, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation, the owner of the Project
Gutenberg-tm trademark, and any other party distributing a Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic work under this agreement, disclaim all
liability to you for damages, costs and expenses, including legal
fees. YOU AGREE THAT YOU HAVE NO REMEDIES FOR NEGLIGENCE, STRICT
LIABILITY, BREACH OF WARRANTY OR BREACH OF CONTRACT EXCEPT THOSE
PROVIDED IN PARAGRAPH 1.F.3. YOU AGREE THAT THE FOUNDATION, THE
TRADEMARK OWNER, AND ANY DISTRIBUTOR UNDER THIS AGREEMENT WILL NOT BE
LIABLE TO YOU FOR ACTUAL, DIRECT, INDIRECT, CONSEQUENTIAL, PUNITIVE OR
INCIDENTAL DAMAGES EVEN IF YOU GIVE NOTICE OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH

trademark owner, any agent or employee of the Foundation, anyone
providing copies of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works in

electronic works, harmless from all liability, costs and expenses,
including legal fees, that arise directly or indirectly from any of
the following which you do or cause to occur: (a) distribution of this

Defect you cause.

Section 2. Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg-tm

Project Gutenberg-tm is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of
computers including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers. It
exists because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations
from people in all walks of life.

Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need are critical to reaching Project Gutenberg-tm's
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg-tm collection will
remain freely available for generations to come. In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg-tm and future
generations. To learn more about the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation and how your efforts and donations can help, see
Sections 3 and 4 and the Foundation information page at
www.gutenberg.org



Section 3. Information about the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation

The Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation is a non profit
501(c)(3) educational corporation organized under the laws of the
state of Mississippi and granted tax exempt status by the Internal
Revenue Service. The Foundation's EIN or federal tax identification
number is 64-6221541. Contributions to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation are tax deductible to the full extent permitted by

Section 4. Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg
Literary Archive Foundation

Project Gutenberg-tm depends upon and cannot survive without wide
spread public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment. Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.

The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States. Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements. We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance. To SEND
DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any particular
state visit www.gutenberg.org/donate

While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.

International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States. U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.

Please check the Project Gutenberg Web pages for current donation
methods and addresses. Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including checks, online payments and credit card donations. To
donate, please visit: www.gutenberg.org/donate

Section 5. General Information About Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works.

Professor Michael S. Hart was the originator of the Project
Gutenberg-tm concept of a library of electronic works that could be
freely shared with anyone. For forty years, he produced and
distributed Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of
volunteer support.

Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as not protected by copyright in
the U.S. unless a copyright notice is included. Thus, we do not
necessarily keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper
edition.

Most people start at our Web site which has the main PG search
facility: www.gutenberg.org

This Web site includes information about Project Gutenberg-tm,
including how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to
subscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.
